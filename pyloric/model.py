def PyloricNetwork() -> jx.Network:
    """Model of the pyloric circuit.

    Model of the pyloric circuit according to:

    Prinz et al. 2003, J Neurophysiol

    We model the network using three cells using the `jx.Network` class:
    - ab_pd: abducens and pre-dorsal pyloric neuron
    - lp: lateral pyloric neuron
    - py: posteroventral pyloric neuron
    which can be accessed by the group names "ab_pd", "lp", and "py" respectively.

    The network is connected as follows using glutamatergic and cholinergic synapses:
    - ab_pd -> lp : glutamatergic
    - ab_pd -> lp : cholinergic
    - ab_pd -> py : glutamatergic
    - ab_pd -> py : cholinergic
    - lp -> ab_pd : glutamatergic
    - lp -> py : glutamatergic
    - py -> lp : glutamatergic

    The simulator was re-implemented based on the cython implementation from:
    https://github.com/mackelab/pyloric and matches the results from the original code.

    Returns:
        The pyloric circuit network.
